        <p>When one thinks of iconic cars from the 1980s and 1990s, it certainly shouldn't be difficult to 
            have the Ferrari Testarossa come to mind. The Testarossa is a mid-engine exotic sports car that 
            would largely be remembered for the interesting and time-sensitive design patterns that Ferrari 
            incorporated and mostly maintained from its inception.
            <br>
            <br>
            In terms of performance, the Testarossa has a 12-cylinder enginer with 380-420 horsepower throughout 
            the years it was made. It has a 5-speed manual transmission and could do 0-60mph in 5.2 seconds. The top 
            speed of the Testarossa was estimated to be 180 mph (290 km/h) and its highly aerodynamic design along 
            with its mid-engine design certainly made this performance possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            In terms of design features, the Testarossa could be said to have been a "project car" because its development 
            originated from fixing the poor design features that were identified in the Ferrari BB 512i. 
            The car had both mechnical and cabin-related problems that the Testarossa design team sought to fix.
            The most notable design feature that people remember the Testarossa for is its unique 
            door and side design. "Side strakes" are the official term for such design, but they were also nicknamed 
            "<i>cheese graters</i>" or "<i>egg slicers</i>." Most are not aware that this design was in fact partially 
            driven by regulatory requirements rather than strictly for cosmetic purposes. At the time of 
            its development, several countries had regulations that prevented very large openings on the exterior of the 
            vehicle, which in this case had to do with cooling the rear-placed engine in the Testarossa. Thus, to fix 
            what would likely have been originally designed as a large hole in the back simply to allow the engine to 
            "breathe," Ferrari added in such a design to partially close off the holes that would have been. Among the 
            other features that identify the car for its time are the rear black lines covering the tail lights. Such a 
            design feature was common to other sports cars of the time, such as the Pontiac Fiero and the DMC DeLorean. 
            The pop-up headlights were also universal features for a sports car of the time period, and the Testarossa indeed followed 
            suit with implementing them. 
            <br>
            <br>
            On the topic of reception and sales, as previously mentioned, the Testarossa was a "problem solved" car. Ferrari 
            was hesitant to test the North American markets due to fears of potential buyers being reminiscent of the problematic 
            BB 512i. The first model year (1984) was only released in European markets as a result. However, the car was very 
            well-received from its inception in the North American markets with the 1985 model year and rapidly grew in popularity, 
            including among celebrities. It was introduced in the United States at a price of $87,000 at the time, but would soar 
            in price to well above $100,000 and nearing the $200,000 mark by the end of its production in the mid-1990s. It gained 
            enough appreciation that it would become known for its placement in movies and TV shows of the time, most notably 
            <i>Miami Vice</i>. Comparable cars that it competed with at the time included the Lamborghini Countach and the Lotus Esprit.
            <br>
            <br>
            In contemporary times, the Testarossa has once again shot up in value. In 2015, a used Testarossa was selling in most American 
            markets for about $40,000 to $50,000. However, as the new decade approached, Testarossas on average have now been selling for 
            $90,000 to $150,000 with more pristine conditioned, low-mileage units selling on the higher end. The recent rise in price demonstrates 
            that despite its age, the Testarossa has indeed matured well and maintained desire among car collectors and car enthusiasts.
